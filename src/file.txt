Four University of Georgia students were expelled from their fraternity on Saturday after a video surfaced in which one of the students made a mock whipping motion with a belt and shouted at another to “pick my cotton.”

In the video, which was initially posted to Snapchat and then reposted on Twitter, two white students are on a bed and two others are standing. One student is covered by a comforter and another holds a belt.

When one of the students says “pick my cotton,” another responds, “I’m not black.” After repeatedly saying “pick my cotton” while making a whipping motion with the belt, a different student says, “You’re not using the right words.” That’s when one of them says: “Wait, get a video of it. Pick my cotton,” followed by a racial slur.

The students all start laughing, the video shows.

The University of Georgia condemned the video. “Racism has no place on our campus,” it said. The university, which is in Athens, about 70 miles east of Atlanta, has the full-time equivalent of 37,190 students, about 70 percent of whom are white.

In a memo, Gregory A. Roskopf, the chief risk officer of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, said the local chapter was temporarily suspended.

In a news release, the fraternity said it was “disgusted, appalled and angered by the remarks” in the video and expelled four members. It said the video was shot in a setting that was unconnected to a fraternity function and did not take place on any chapter premises.
